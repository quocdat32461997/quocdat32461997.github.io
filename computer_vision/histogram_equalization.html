<h1> Histogram Equalization - Enhancing Image Contrast </h1>

<p>Enhancing image contrast is a common task in Photoshop to improve the image quality,
and to improve the image beauty. Let's look at 2 images below.</p>

<img src = "statics/bef_hist_eq.jpg"/>
<img src = "statics/after_hist_eq.jpg"/>

<p>Obviously, the second image looks more attractive than the "boring" image. One method of
enhancing contrast is Histogram Euqalization. Of course, there are tons of more powerful algorithms designed by Adobe and other companies.
However, I choose to talk about this algorithm because it is a good example to teach people what histogram is and how to read it.</p>

  <h3>Histogram</h3>
  <h5>
    is a plot showing the distrbution or frequency of continuous data. Theoratically,
    histograms use vertical axis to denote independent variables and horizontal axis to denote dependent varibles. In other words, histograms
    use columns to denote the quantities of groups in the horizontal axis.

    For instance, in the graph below, the histogram shows the frequency/distribution of iPhone sales from 2007 to 2018.
    <img src = "statics/histogram_example.png"/>
    Obviously, this histogram has iPhone sales in millions of units as the vertical axis and years as the horizontal axis. It is easy to point out the histogram shows the increasing
    pattern of iPhone sales. <b> Now you get Histogram in general. How about Histogram in Computer Vision?</b>

    <b>Histogram Example of an Image</b> <br> <br>

    In Computer Vision, every image is composed of pixels that every color of pixels ranges from 0 to 255 (0 is darkesst and 255 is brightest).
    A color mode of images are RGB (e.g. 3 color channels of Reg-Green-Blue). Now, look at the histogram of the above gray-scale image, the vertical axis represents
    the number of pixels; and the horizontal axis represetns the gray color brightness (0 is black and 255 is white).
    The histogram has the bell shape that most of red columns are placed in center betweeen 150 and 200, which implies that pixels in the image are not clearly different in colors.
    This is true that the contrast in the corresponding image is not clear.

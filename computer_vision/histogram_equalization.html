<h1> Histogram Equalization - Enhancing Image Contrast </h1>

<p>Enhancing image contrast is a common task in Photoshop to improve the image quality,
and to improve the image beauty. Let's look at 2 images below.</p>

<img src = "statics/bef_hist_eq.jpg"/>
<img src = "statics/after_hist_eq.jpg"/>

<p>Obviously, the second image looks more attractive than the "boring" image. One method of
enhancing contrast is Histogram Euqalization. Of course, there are tons of more powerful algorithms designed by Adobe and other companies.
However, I choose to talk about this algorithm because it is a good example to teach people what histogram is and how to read it.</p>

  <h3>Histogram</h3>
  <h5>
    is a plot showing the distrbution or frequency of continuous data. Theoratically,
    histograms use vertical axis to denote independent variables and horizontal axis to denote dependent varibles. In other words, histograms
    use columns to denote the quantities of groups in the horizontal axis.

  <p>
    For instance, in the graph below, the histogram shows the frequency/distribution of iPhone sales from 2007 to 2018.
    <img src = "statics/histogram_example.png"/>
    Obviously, this histogram has iPhone sales in millions of units as the vertical axis and years as the horizontal axis. It is easy to point out the histogram shows the increasing
    pattern of iPhone sales. <b> Now you get Histogram in general. How about Histogram in Computer Vision?</b>

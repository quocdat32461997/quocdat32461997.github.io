Hey guys, I am Dat (Eric) Quoc Ngo, a Master student in Intelligent System at University of Texas - Dallas.
Currently, I am conducting research on Text and Graph Generation under supervision of Prof. Jessica Ouyang.
Before that, I gained my B.S. in Computer Science in UT-Dallas. My elementary English teachers told that
I could not speak and use foreign languages fluently. Hence, I dedicate my time to solve language and text
problems. Also, please address by **Eric** since my first name is pronounced similar to *that* that I am always confused 
if people are calling me or just simply saying *that* word.

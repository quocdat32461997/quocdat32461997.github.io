<h1> Transfer Learning for Chest Disease Detection </h1>

<p>
	September 2019 - I and 3 other students joined an AI Medical Hackathon
	held by Mr. Tarry Singh and Cuare AI. This is to show steps we made
	during the competition.
</p>


<p>
	<h4>Problem: </h4>
	X-ray scans of chest areas have been used to detect cancer and
	other kinds of diseases within Chest area. However, the diagnosis based
	on the X-ray scans by humans is time-consuming. Hence, the question is
	to develop Machine Learning algorithm to quickly identify diseases on
	X-Ray scans.

		<h4> Perform Data Explanatory Data Analysis </h4>
		<p>
			Obviously, the given dataset contains: <br>
				* Finding labels - Disease name: these labels would be encoded to classes for multi-binary classification <br>
				* Other features: not considered as out of scope of this blog

		<p> <br> One conclusion here is the meadian age of all patients is 48.47. Obviously, if look at max row, we observed the odd age of 414 which would be changed to 100</p>

	<section id = "encode classes of diseases">
		<br>
		<h4>Feature Engineering</h4>
		<p> Encode classes of 14 types of diseases as following: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Cardiomegaly - 0 </li>
			<li> Emphysema - 1 </li>
			<li> Effusion - 2 </li>
			<li> Hernia - 3 </li>
			<li> Infiltration - 4 </li>
			<li> Mass - 5 </li>
			<li> Nodule - 6 </li>
			<li> Atelectasis - 7 </li>
			<li> Pneumothorax - 8 </li>
			<li> Pleural_Thickening - 9 </li>
			<li> Pneumonia - 10 </li>
			<li> Fibrosis - 11 </li>
			<li> Edema - 12 </li>
			<li> Consolidation - 13 </li>
		</ul>

	<section id = "image_processing">
		<h4>Build data loader</h4>
		<p>
			In Image Processing, standardizing images is a necessary technique to prevent
			over-explosion of features. When taking standardization, we look for the standard normal distribution within images.
			Standardizing is implemented within the customized dataloader by using <u>Sequence</u> class from Keras and <u>process_input</u> function desgined by mobilenet_v2. <br><br>
			The dataloder return 2 objects: batches of images and batches of labels (disease classes).

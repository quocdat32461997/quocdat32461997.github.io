<h1> Transfer Learning for Chest Disease Detection </h1>

<p>
	September 2019 - I and 3 other students joined an AI Medical Hackathon
	held by Mr. Tarry Singh and Cuare AI. This is to show steps we made
	during the competition.

<p>
	<h4>Problem: </h4>
	X-ray scans of chest areas have been used to detect cancer and
	other kinds of diseases within Chest area. However, the diagnosis based
	on the X-ray scans by humans is time-consuming. Hence, the question is
	to develop Machine Learning algorithm to quickly identify diseases on
	X-Ray scans.

			Obviously, the given dataset contains: <br>
				Finding labels - Disease name: these labels would be encoded to classes for multi-binary classification
				Other features: not considered as out of scope of this blog</p>

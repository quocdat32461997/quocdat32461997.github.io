# Titanic Survival Rate Prediction

RMS Titatnic is the largest and most luxurious cruise ship in the early 20th that carried travelers and immigrants from Europe to the States.
However, it sank shortly after the collisino with a huge ice berg in the Alantic. The question is which factors determine who survives. Hence,
in this post, I implemented various Machine Learning algorithms to predict the survival rate of passengeers.

**Goal is:** to predict the survial rate of passengers
**Achievements**: 
* Applied models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest-Neighbors, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest
* Result: found that Random Forest achieved 93% of Training data and 73% on Validation data

**Dataset is avaiable at:** [https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic])https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic_

# Loss Function for Super-Image-Super-Resolution (SISR)

In SISR, Autoencoder and U-Net are heavily used; however, they are well-known for difficulties in training to convergence. The choice of loss function plays an important role in guiding models to optimum. Today, I introduce 2 loss functions for Single-Image-Super-Resolution.

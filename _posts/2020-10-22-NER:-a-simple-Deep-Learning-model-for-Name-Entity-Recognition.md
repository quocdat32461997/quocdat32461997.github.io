![img](/assets/bilstm-crf-network.png)

The end-to-end implementation of BiLSTM-CRF model for Name Entity Recognition based on the following paper: [Bidirectional LSTM-CRF Models for Sequence Tagging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01991).

## Shipped with:
* [x] Full Tensorflow Data pipeline for Text-Preprocessing
* [x] Functions to save the pretarined model into SavedFormat of Tensorflow Serving for Fine-tuning or Deployment.
* Inference functionality:
  * [x] Local server
  * [ ] AWS

**Details of implementation** is available here: [NER](https://github.com/quocdat32461997/NER)

Implementatino of Computer Vision and Image Processing algorithms

## Download
* At [MoCV](https://pypi.org/project/MoCV/)
* Or type
```
pip3 install mocv
```

## Algorithm supported:
* Histogram - compute image histogram
* Histogram Equalization - equalize image histogram to enhance image contrast
* Linear Scale - lienarly scale image histogram
* Segmentation by Optimal Thresholding
* Scaling by Nearest Neighbor
* Scaling by Bilinear Interpolation

  Hi, <br>
  Welcome to my Research area <br>
  I love cutting-edge technologies (retro tech are new because no one knows everything).
  My interest lies on Machine Learning, Neural Engineering, and Computer Vision. Below are
  projects and topics that I have researched and published releant papers.

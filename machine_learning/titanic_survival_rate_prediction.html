    RMS Titatnic is the largest and most luxurious cruise ship in the early 20th that carried travelers and immigrants from Europe to the States.
    However, it sank shortly after the collisino with a huge ice berg in the Alantic. The question is which factors determine who survives. Hence,
    in this post, I implemented various Machine Learning algorithms to predict the survival rate of passengeers.

    The Titanic dataset could be found <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic"> here </a>.

    <h4> Inspect data </h4>

      <b> First look into data </b>

      Literally, the first column is the row index. This column could be ignored.
      Other columns/features that I consider as significant:
      <ul style = "list-style-type: none;">
        <li>Survived - the boolean value indicating if the passenger survies</li>
        <li>Pclass - ticket class</li>
        <li>Sex - gender (It is believed that women had higher priority to get on the rescue boats)</li>
        <li>Age - how old is he/she? (Children and elders usually get on rescue boats earlier)</li>
        <li>SibSP - Number of siblings (Possible) </li>
        <li>Parch - number of parents/children (Householders are supposed to have higher survival rate)</li>
        <li>Fare - how much tickets were paid (Fare is correlated with Pclass but not guaranteed) </li>
        <li>Embarked - The start location (Some people leaves may get off the trip before the sink) </li>
      </ul>

      <b>
        Look at statistics of data <br>
        This step is important to inspect the Guassian data distribution (expected to see this)

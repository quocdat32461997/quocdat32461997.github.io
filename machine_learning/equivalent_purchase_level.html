  <h4 id = "problem_statement">
    This is the challenge/problem by eBay that many similar
    listings may have different prices. This fact poses
    inconvenience to eBay's customers and to me as well when shopping.
    Hence, I want to solve this challenge by developing Deep Clustering algorithm
    to cluster same products together.

    <h4>Challenges</h4>
    <p>
      A big challenge of <b>Unsupervised Image Clustering</b> is no pre-trained models
      specified for clustering images. And Unsupervised Image Clustering is difficult
      as natural due to the need of huge dataset to learn representatives of images. Another
      challenge is the big dataset of <b>1 million images and corresponding captions</b>
      (upto 1 TB) given by eBay for training Clustering models.

    RMS Titatnic is the largest and most luxurious cruise ship in the early 20th that carried travelers and immigrants from Europe to the States.
    However, it sank shortly after the collisino with a huge ice berg in the Alantic. The question is which factors determine who survives. Hence,
    in this post, I implemented various Machine Learning algorithms to predict the survival rate of passengeers.

<h2> Linear Regression </h2>

<section>
  <p>
    In Linear Algebra, we must solve many problems in the form <i> y = mx + b </i>. This simple equation
    is actually Linear Regression used in many sequence prediction. It is simple, powerful to capture the linear
    weight (slope of the line), m, and bias, b, between predictor, x, and target, y. <br>

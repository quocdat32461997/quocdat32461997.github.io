<h2> Linear Regression </h2>

<section>
  <p> Linear Regression is a simple regression learning algorithm that its model learns the linear combination of features of inputs.</p>

  <section>
    <h5> y = wx + b </h5>
    <p> This is the simplest linear regression algorithm that yields the linear line fitting 2 points.
      However, when the data has more than 2 entries (usually in reality),
      it is difficult to find the linear line that fit all entries. Also,
      this algorithm is sensitive to noise (outliners).
